# Quantifying Job Description Complexity and Its Association to Freelance Earnings Using NLP
This repository hosts the code, data, and documentation for a thesis project examining the relationship between professional skills, country economic classification, and salary outcomes. The study extracts and quantifies skills from job-related data, conducts regression analysis, and evaluates the impact of skills and country categories (e.g., first-world, second-world) on salary levels.

# Project Overview
The project investigates whether skills and a countryâ€™s economic classification influence salaries. Using natural language processing (NLP) to extract skills from datasets like job postings or resumes, it categorizes countries by economic development (e.g., GDP-based tiers) and applies regression models to quantify their effects on earnings.
